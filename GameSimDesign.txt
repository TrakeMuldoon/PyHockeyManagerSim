Puck Action is resolved as follows
1. Check Zone
2. Check Possession
3. Decide Possessor ActionActtempt
4. Evaluate Attempt Success
5. Move Puck
6. Move All Other Players
7. Check for Penalties (move to 6, or 4?, or 5?)


All AttemptSuccess will be 
Likelihood of Player A Winning: (Player A stat + 100) / (Player A stat + 100) + (Player B stat + 100) 
Tweak the "100" up to make individual stats matter less, change it down to make individual stats matter more
