Players and the puck will move from zone to zone
There will be probabilities based on the players and zone involved and to where the puck will go from each zone that it is in

Stats will be largely used individiually to resolve conflicts

Player Stats
Athletic
- Speed (to resolve races)
- Endurance (how their stats flag over the course of the game)

Offensive
- Puck Control (to resolve dekes)
- Short Shooting (Zones close to the net)
- Long Shooting (Zones far from the net)
- Passing

Defensive
- Shot Blocking (to oppose Long Shooting)
- Stick-Checking (to oppose puck control and passing)

Goalie Stats
- Pads
- Glove
- Blocker
- Stick
- Passing

Game will consist of 3 20 minute periods
The game is take up by "PuckActions"

Each PuckAction can take a different number of seconds, ranging from 3-10 seconds.
So a game will have a minimum of 360 PuckActions and a maximum of 1200

Puck Action is resolved as follows
1. Check Possession
2. Determine Zone for Possessor
3. Look up PlayerActions and weights and determine PlayerAction
4. Look up PlayerActionOptions and weights and determine PlayerOption
5. Determine opposition for Option
6. Determine ActionSuccess or failure
6. Look up PlayerActionOptionOutcome weights based on success or failure
5. Move Puck
6. Move All Other Players
7. Check for Penalties (move to 6, or 4?, or 5?)


All AttemptSuccess will be 
Likelihood of Possessor Winning: (Possessor stat + 100) / (Possessor stat + 100) + (Defender stat + 100) 
Tweak the "100" up to make individual stats matter less, change it down to make individual stats matter more

Player who wins the faceoff gains puck control

If no one has control of the puck, a "race" is created.
Race:
  Players calculate how many zones they need to pass through to get the puck
  Players at the lowest number of zones away all gain a value of random (0-1) * (100 + SPEED)
  Ties or close ties are broken by Puck Control (?) or PC + Stick Checking (?)
  Highest Value gains control

Controlled Puck:
Defensive Zone options
Percentage choice of each depending on STRATEGY
- Pass
  Percentage choice based on STRATEGY
  Forward, Lateral ( including current zone), Backwards
  OUTCOMES
  Passed, missed (lost control), interception
- Breakout (if available)
  Attempt to forward pass with a higher probabilty of leaving the zone, and lower probability of completed pass
  OUTCOMES
  Forward Pass, Clear Zone (opposition control), Clear Zone (No possessor), interception
- Carry
  Percentage choice based on STRATEGY
  Forward, Lateral (including current zone), backwards
  OUTCOMES
  Move Zone, Lose Control (no possessor), interception
- Clear
  Very High probabilty of leaving the zone, probability of icing , depending on factors
  OUTCOMES - push puck past blueline
  Clear Zone (No controller), Clear Zone (opposition), Icing, Interception

Neural Zone options
  - Pass
    Percentage choice based on STRATEGY
      Forward, Lateral ( including current zone), Backwards
      OUTCOMES
      Passed, missed (lost control), interception
- Carry
  Percentage choice based on STRATEGY
  Forward, Lateral (including current zone), backwards
   Move Zone, Lose Control (no possessor), interception, offside
- Ice/Dump
  Very High probabilty of leaving the zone, probability of icing , depending on factors
  OUTCOMES - push puck into corner
  Clear Zone (No controller), Clear Zone (opposition), Icing, Interception

Offensive Zone Options
- Pass
- Shoot
- Deke


Coaching STRATEGY:
Aggressive
Neutral
Conservative


Enums/Pivots
ZONE: 1 of 16
STRATEGY
PLAYER_ACTION
PLAYER_ACTION_OPTIONS
PLAYER_ACTION_OUTCOMES (would be for all PLAYER_ACTION_OPTIONS, including some PLAYER_ACTIONs without options)
OUTCOMES dictate the following required information 
  ZONE: Puck Location
  PLAYER: Puck Controller (null means No Controller)


ENDURANCE
- every 30 seconds of ice time, stats go down by 1
- every 30 seconds of rest-time, stats go up by Stat:Endurance / 100 * 0.1
